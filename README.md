# Lesson Files for [Radical Wordpress](http://radicalwordpress.com)

## How to Use These Files

These files are companion to the book Radical WordPress by Paul Edmon Graham. They will probably be of limited use to you for production purposes but you are free to do as you will as these files are released under the GPL v3. If you're interested in a full-featured toolkit that espouses many of the same ideas as Radical WordPress, please have a look at [Scentric](https://github.com/bytefair/scentric), a more full-featured, modern take on Automattic's toolkits.

The book has been arranged to list the commit number to which you can rewind if you'd like to "replay" that section of code development.
